# 🐍 Snake Game – A Didactic Python Project using Pygame

This is a simple Snake-Clone programmed entirely in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) library.  
It was designed as part of a **didactic teaching unit** at RWTH Aachen University to introduce secondary-level pupils (grade 9/10) to the fundamentals of game development, logical structures, and event-driven programming.

---

## 🎯 Educational Objective

This project serves both as a working game and as an **interactive, self-study coding activity** in the context of the German technology curriculum.  
It focuses on:

- Understanding basic Python structures (loops, lists, conditionals)
- Using an external library (Pygame) to build interactive programs
- Applying logical thinking to solve real problems (collision, movement, input handling)
- Encouraging autonomous debugging and experimentation

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Growing snake and collision detection
- Randomly generated food positions
- Score display at the end of the game
- Fully commented code for educational clarity

---

## 🛠 Installation

To run the game, you need Python 3 installed on your system along with the `pygame` library.

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LStoneyy/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
```

### 2. Install the dependencies

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### 3. Run the game

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

## 🎮 Controls

- **Arrow keys** – Control the direction of the snake
- **Close window** – Ends the game

---

## 📚 Pedagogical Use

This project was developed to accompany a modular programming unit, which is not yet finished. It can be used to:

- Introduce pupils to real-world Python applications
- Demonstrate programming principles in a visual and interactive way
- Encourage step-by-step understanding through guided commenting
- Serve as a scaffold for creative expansion (speed levels, walls, menus, etc.)
